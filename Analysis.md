Write a summary of how I worked through the analysis - first do this, then try that,

- Can you replicate all the work?
Automate everything with make/ipython

- Please provide notes or a summary of how you worked through the analysis. This homework is meant for us to understand
how you think through a problem.
Do analysis in ipython notebook, with stream of consciousness, or write up a summary of how I worked through it.

- Don't fret about getting the *right* answer. How you communicate your approach to analysis is just as important.
EXPLAIN THINKING PROCESS DURING ANALYSIS. But also present findings/analysis clearly later.
question: do I only present analysis in the notebook, or also summarize it in a writeup?


- Analytical skill: Need to answer the questions, and back it up with data.
(Does he actually know how to analyze the data correctly to answer his question?)

- Presentation: They need to be able to arrive at the conclusions that I've made
(Okay, so maybe he knows the right analysis to do, and can do it. But can does he present said
analysis clearly enough that we can follow it and arrive at the conclusions?

- Technical: Technical skill will be assessed based on your ability to create a clean,
reproducible dataset with the tools you choose to use. (Make, clean, well documented code.)




How many stores are there?
How many products are there? Per category?
How many customers are there? Per store?
How many promotions are there? Sales per promotion?

Distribution of purchases per customer
Distribution of money spent per customer


Sales over time
Profits over time


**Question 1**

Management is trying to better understand what is happening at these food marts.
To that end, please create some visualizations to help us better understand the following
dimensions of the Foodmart data:

- Category of products sold
- Brand of products sold


- What category of product sells the most?
- What category of product brings in the most money?
- What category of product is the most profitable - provides the greatest profit per unit? (Boost sales on these.)
- Does this vary by store?

- What brand of product sells the most?
- What brand of product brings in the most money?
- What brand of product is the most profitable - provides the greatest profit per unit? (Boost sales on these.)
- Does this vary by store?



**Question 2**

Highlight 2-3 insights from previous year's data to help inform next year's strategy for growing sales and profits.

"Please provide an executive summary of your findings, the implications for Foodmart, and the supporting analysis."
Question, finding/conclusion (answering the question), implication of finding, and the analysis.

Analytical: did he find some findings? does he suggest strategy for boosting sales/profits, and do findings inform it?
is the analysis behind the findings legit?
Presentation: did he explain findings clearly? can we follow the analysis behind the findings?



Promotions with some media_types lose money, while others make more money than if you didn't run them.
Implication: do more of those.

Promotions on certain products do better than others. Do them on those products.
Promotions at certain times do better than others. Do them at those times.
Promotions with certain duration do better than others.
Run a regression on this?

Some product categories are very profitable. Stock more of them.
Some product brands are very profitable. Stock more of them.


Stock certain things that sell more. If you just have more of these, people will buy them more?
Don't waste your limited space with stuff that doesn't sell well.
Small things that have high profit
