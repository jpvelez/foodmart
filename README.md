# Etsy Analyst Homework

## Intro

As a Data Analyst at Etsy, you will regularly munge, analyze and present data to inform product and business decisions across the company and across the idea lifecycle. Your ability to write reproducible, generalizable code to access data from a variety of sources, analyze it and communicate your findings will be an important part of your day-to-day work. So, to that end, we'd love to see you take some real transaction data and gather some insight from it!

## General guidelines:
- We should be able to replicate your work - please provide any code, notes, and/or documents you used while analyzing the data. This helps follow your thought process.
- Feel free to tackle the dataset however you'd like – use any language or tools you want to, and visualize this data however seems appropriate and with any tool you feel is best suited to the task.
- Please provide notes or a summary of how you worked through the analysis. This homework is meant for us to understand how you think through a problem.
- Don't fret about getting the *right* answer. How you communicate your approach to analysis is just as important.
- If you find that you have some time and want to investigate ideas outside of the questions below, we'd be delighted but it's not expected. We understand that you've got a busy schedule.

## Instructions

In the raw_data folder, you should find 4 inter-related datasets: a dataset of transactions, a dataset of products, a dataset of product_classes, and a dataset with information about promotions. The original source is a freely available Foodmart dataset, downloaded from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/dlpage.phi-integration.com/pentaho/mondrian/mysql-foodmart-database/foodmart_mysql.tar.gz). You might need to do some cleaning to the data to get it into a workable state.

**Question 1**

Management is trying to better understand what is happening at these food marts. To that end, please create some visualizations to help us better understand the following dimensions of the Foodmart data:
- Category of products sold
- Brand of products sold

**Question 2**

The executive team at Foodmart is starting to brainstorm approaches for growing sales and profitability next year. And by next year, we mean 1998. :) They've asked the analytics team to highlight 2-3 insights from the previous year's data to help inform the strategy for next year.

Please provide an executive summary of your findings, the implications for Foodmart, and the supporting analysis.

**Question 3**

Please include 1-2 work examples with accompanying summaries that you feel are relevant to this position. Feel free to strip out any confidential or personally identifiable information. 

## How We Will Evaluate Your Submission

Your responses to these questions will be evaluated on three criteria: analytical skill, technical skill, and presentation. Analytical skill will be assessed based on your ability to answer the questions backed up by data. Technical skill will be assessed based on your ability to create a clean, reproducible dataset with the tools you choose to use. Lastly, presentation will be assessed on the our ability to easily follow your submission and arrive at the conclusions you’ve made.
